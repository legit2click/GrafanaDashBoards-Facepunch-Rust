### Custom Grafana Dashboards for The Facepunch game: Rust
Made these while playing with a large group of people on an official server. The game had an app that allowed you to place monitoring on your boxes. I thought it would be fun to make a dashboard for it. I've since stopped playing, but I thought I'd share it here. To work with the devloper of the Rust Plus Bot to make your own please feel free to reach out.
